  ## Known-Bugs

  Some bugs in navgating through the menu. There also appears to be a bug on exit that can be resolved by pressing enter one more time for the app to quit.

  ## Next-Steps

  The app for now the update function can only update the employee role. Will need a way to update the role with a department id as well as deleting entries.
